    <h1>Major Nations</h1>
    <p>
      There are ten major nations, each corresponds to an element. The five nations corresponding to the dark elements have their capitals on earth, and are mostly human. The five nations corresponding the the light elements have their capitals on Ithrin, and are mostly Ithrinian (go figure). Peimein is the only nation where Ithinians are not allowed, and Gailaborne is the only nation where humans are not allowed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Space: Epros</li>
      <li>Dark: The Tezago Empire</li>
      <li>Water: The Democratic Peoples' Republic of Peimein</li>
      <li>Rock: Aglon</li>
      <li>Magnetism: Okhyan</li>
      <li>Time: Deilon</li>
      <li>Light: Alastra</li>
      <li>Fire: Gailaborne Kingdom</li>
      <li>Air: Oshil</li>
      <li>Lightning: Bleinail</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These maps show the political boundaries on Earth and Ithrin. The nations are color-coded by element, the red/black checkered island on earth is uninhabited, as it's where the elementals re-spawn:

    <h2>Allies, enemies, and culture</h2>
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Epros</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Oshil (shares Ureinoes), Tezago (aids against Peimein), Deilon (religious reasons)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Peimein (blocks westward ships)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>People tend to live far away from each other, with large properties, and little interpersonal interaction. The population tends to be rich, with many successful engineers being Eprosi citizens.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Tezago</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Epros (aids against Peimein), Okhyan (aids against Peimein and Aglon)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Peimein (took a Tezago island), Aglon (attempts to take northern Tezago)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Tezago is ruled by an emperor, who enforces many orthodox rules; such as being required to follow old religious practices, and learning to speak the ancient Tezago language. It is believed that Tezago was the first nation, and the Tezago people are proud of that heritage.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Peimein</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Aglon (offered half of Okhyan if aided in conquest)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Deilon, Alastra, Gailaborne, Oshil, Bleinail (still fighting the Great Beast War), Okhyan (attempt to expand to the mainland), Epros (would side with Okhyan if ships could get through), Tezago (sides with Epros)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Peimein is militaristic and ruled by a totalitarian dictator. Peimein, along with Gailaborne, never officially stopped fighting the Great Beast War. The Peimein-Gailaborne conflict still runs hot, with frequent combats.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Aglon</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Peimein (aid in Okhyan conflict), Alastra (Terral portion)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Okhyan (conflict over west peninsula, then just everything), Tezago (conflict over northern Tezago)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Most of Aglon's citizens don't care for the conflicts. More people live on Terral than on Aglon's Earth territory. The Aglon Earth territory is much more conservative than the Terral territory and struggles to govern both, making them almost separate governments. The Earth territory is similar to Okhyan. The Terral territory is nearby an Alastra territory and tends to mimic their culture.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Okhyan</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Tezago (provides aid vs Aglon), Alastra (provides resources)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Aglon (conflict over west peninsula), Peimein (attempts to take over east Okhyan)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Okhyan is falling apart. Citizens either help with the war, or are neglected. Those who do aid in the war are also often hungry and sick. On the verge of collapse, the only thing that keeps them going is donations from Alastra (Alastra donates these resources because they hold the idea of having 10 elemental nations as important).</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Deilon</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Epros (religious reasons)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>None.</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Deilon tends to find physical conflict to be counter-productive, preferring a diplomatic approach. History is carefully studied, and the future carefully planned for. Of the Ithrinian nations, Deilon is the most friendly towards humans. People tend to be a lot more open to sharing personal pasts as well.</p>
    <p>Deilon is also home to the Fellowship of the Ancient ones. A orthidox-compatible religion that believes that when people die, they restart their lives with some memories of what happened before.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Alastra</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Aglon (Terral portion), Okhyan (religious reasons)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Gailaborne, Peimein, Tezago (these three nations have been known to hide knowledge from their citizens)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Alastra has the best post-secondary <i>and</i> post-tertiary education of the known world. All schooling is free, and many of the biggest libraries are in Alastrian cities. These libraries contain more than just books; they hold regular free seminars, job trainings, and even often haev public bath-houses and kitchens. Due to its stance on education, Alastra enjoys the highest GDP of any nation. However, citizens without an interest in scholarly activities- while important to the economy- are looked down upon as a lower class.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Gailaborne</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>None.</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Epros, Tezago, Peimein, Aglon, Okhyan (still fighting The Great Beast War), Oshil (dispute over an island, noncombative)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Gailaborne citizens are fierce and competitive. Most believe that humans are evil and The Great Beast War should have never ended. No humans are allowed within the kingdom. All citizens are required to worship their king, Warrior-King Koto Nogaila VIII. They believe that their nation has been sustained by the power of elemental fire, and as such the country has a higher number of magic users per capita than normal. Water magic is strictly banned.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Oshil</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>Erpos (shares Ureinoes)</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Gailaborne (is annoyed with them. Took an island to try to pick a fight, but Gailaborne refuses to fight another temporal nation)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Oshil tends to be religious, worshiping the sky. They partnered with Eprosian engineers to develop a flying city, which they built on Ureinoes. Many Oshili citizens have been emigrating to Ureinoes and Chaemol, as they see life in the air as spiritually better. They tend to be more extroverted and jovial than normal; despite being very religious, they hold very little as sacred.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset>
    <legend><h3>Bleinail</h3></legend>
    <h4>Allies</h4>
    <p>None.</p>
    <h4>Enemies</h4>
    <p>Gailaborne (both wish to expand their territory in the Voph System. There's still plenty of land, so there hasn't been much conflict)</p>
    <h4>General Culture</h4>
    <p>Bleinail cares about speed. Common phrases like "please", "thank you", or "how are you" are seen as rude and time-wasting. Bleinailian citizens tend to dislike spending a long time on any task, splitting tasks up if they take too long.</p>
    <p>
      Bleinail is also fasinated with human culture. A few of the extremists started the Skinned Brotherhood. Members of the cult shave their fur/scales, clip their ears, and often surgically reduces their snouts to more closly resemble humans. Members of this cult are usually met with disgust by everyone else.
