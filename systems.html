    <h1>Solar Systems</h1>
    <p>
      There are seven solar systems that are currently inhabited. There are two main methods of travel between these long distances. The first option is a warp-drive; made in Epros using spatial magic, warpdrives allow a ship to skip over portions of space. However, since they are made using magic, they have to be made by hand, which makes them expensive (WL4). The other option is to take the public portal system; a few select planets have portals to other select planets. However, these portals are small, have long waiting lines, and can only go to certain places.
