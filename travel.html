    <h2>Space-ports</h2>
    <p>Most inhabited planets will have at least one space-port in orbit around them. These ports serve as a hub for travel between different planets. They have large hangers for ships, both commercial and private. The launching bay has an open "window" made using air magic-tech. This window is basically an open hole in the side of the port through which the station's air can't pass through.</p>
    
    <h2>Using the space-ports</h2>
    <p>Getting off the planet is the first step. There are specialized ship for this purpose. They are powerful, but very short range; just enough to get off the planet and navigate the orbit. From there, people transfer to a longer-range ship. Whether that's a simple inter-planetary ship, or an interstellar one equipped with a warp drive. The new ship will then take off from the station and eventually arrive at a different port. Taking this journey through a commercial line usually costs WL2. Sometimes WL3.</p>
    
    <h2>Portal system</h2>
    <p>There are two permanent pairs of portals set up. All four ends of these portals are held in space-ports. One pair leads from Itrhin [Sol Delta] to Vael [Iqaon Gamma], the other leads from Vael to Laevon [Voph Gamma]. These portals are small, roughly 5 feet across, making it so only one person can go through at a time. Because of this, use of the portal requires a ticket costing WL2. The tickets may cost WL3 in times of high traffic.</p>
