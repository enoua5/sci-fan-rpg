    <h1>World History</h1>
    <h2>Mythos</h2>
    <p>
      It begins with a being known as The Great Sentience. As a being older than time or space, It has no physical form, though some think of It as the universe itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For whatever reason, The Great Sentience began creating a universe within Its mind. An important thing to know is that It never creates something alone. It always creates two opposing things at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      First It created space, and with it, time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then It created rock, which was formed into the first planet: the Earth. With the rock, came air, gathering around the newly formed planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came fire, forming the first star; the sun that the Earth revolves around. With it, water filling the oceans.
    </p>
    <p>
      It created light to glow from the fire, and with the light, darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it created lightning striking from the sky to start fires, and magnetism in certain rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two categories of elements, each containing one element from each pair. The "spatial" or "dark" elements, being space, darkness, earth, water, and magnetism are associated with stability and calmness. The "temporal" or "light" elements, being time, light, air, fire, and lightning are associated with chaos and power. Each element tends to work well with the other members of its group, and poorly with the others. For example: time progresses to cause a bolt of lightning to strike down from the sky, sparking a fire, all of which casts light. However, it scorches earth, and does all sorts of nonsense in water, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each element is also associated with a color.
      Fire: red, water: blue, earth: brown, air: orange, lightning: cyan, magnetism: magenta, light: white, dark: black, time: green, space: purple
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Sentience wanted there to be more to the universe than a single planet orbiting a single star, but It was already feeling creatively drained. To remedy this, It created 10 creator gods: one for each element. They manifested as small crystals, with colors matching their respective elements. Emanating from the crystals: elemental energy, adding to the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again, everything It creates comes in pairs. With the creator 10 gods came 10 destroyer gods, manifesting as elemental beings; living versions of their respective elements. The forces were evenly matched, the universe being expanded as quickly as it was being destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To combat the destructive forces, The Great Sentience created 10 elemental weapons capable of killing the destroyer gods. The opposite creation in this case was a circle of pillars on an island. The destroyers re-spawn on top of those pillars shortly after being killed. Whether that's a few seconds later, or a few weeks. It varies. However, since there's time between the death and re-spawn, the creators can have some time to create without it being immediately destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problem. The creator gods are crystals. They can't use weapons. Together, they invented a warrior to wield the weapons for them: a human. With the help of The Great Sentience, they created the first 10 humans. The Great Sentience provided the new creations with life, to prevent them from being immediately destroyed. However, with life came death. Life only delays the destruction, and death inevitably comes to collect the due.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for now, the warriors were alive. They fashioned the creator gods into necklaces so that they could help them in their fights; picked up their weapons, and began fighting back the destruction, allowing the universe to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, the warriors were getting old and dying. To continue their work, each passed the title down to one of their children, along with the elemental weapon, the creator god, and some training. That line continued down, each warrior passing the title down to their descendants (or a highly trusted friend if they had no living descendants). Occasionally artifacts get added or removed from the list of items passed down, but the weapon and the necklace always remain in that list.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little note about the religions this gave rise to: The Great Sentience is rarely worshiped. It stopped interacting with the universe after it created life, so there's no real reason to worship It. The creator gods get a little more worship, but they don't care for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main group that gets worshiped is the warriors: they're human (and later many of them are anthro), and so care about human things. Some of them choose to use their position (and the power gained from wearing a literal god around their neck) to help people. Some- especially with the title being passed down through generations- make themselves kings. In fact, biggest nations are named after the first warriors.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's other mythologies in the world of course, but that's the mythology that actually happened in that universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Modern History</h2>
    <p>
      Humanity was preparing to colonize a second planet: Itrhin, the next planet away from Sol. They were getting close to having it terraformed, and were getting ready the colonization team. According to international law, anyone they sent on the mission would be entitled to pay as though they were on the clock 24/7. This was an issue, as many laborers would be needed to make the expedition successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remedy this, the government commissioned Doctor Mokorai to create a solution. The doctor was a successful genetic engineer, highly praised for his work in devolving a cure for cancer. He was to create a slave race, strong enough to perform manual labor, and smart enough to take orders. In order to do this, a created the beast race (later known as the Ithrinians), which were humanoid animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to his presumption that the beasts couldn't possibly get any smarter than an animal or a machine, Doctor Mokorai failed to notice how smart they were getting. The beasts eventually started a revolution, escaping from the lab, taking over the launch center, and colonizing Itrhin themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three-hundred years went by. The Ithrin people spread across Ithrin, forming nations. The nations of Earth would occasionally try to take back the planet, but warfare between planets just was not yet reasonable. Both sides spread negative rumors about the other. Eventually, a small group of Ithrinian terrorists launched an attack against an Earth city. A few exchanges of attacks later, and the two planets were tied into the Great Beast War.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war was eventually settled diplomatically, though some racial tension remains. However, as the two groups grew closer, and technology grew more advanced, settlements began springing up in neighboring solar systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our story takes place 200 years into the inter-solar age.
