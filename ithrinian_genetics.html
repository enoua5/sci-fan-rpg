    <h1>Ithrinian Genetics</h1>
    <p>
      Ithrinians are a humanoid species. They take the form of two animals hybridized together, in humanoid form. Land mammals are the most common animal to be found in Ithrinian genetics, followed by reptiles (including dragons), and then birds. Other animals are possible, but are very rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ithrinians only need for one parent to be an Ithrinian, as they are genetically compatible with humans and most other forms of animal life. However, this is seen as extremely taboo, and most involved in it try to hide it, especially the children born from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two species that make up an Ithrinians genome come from their two parents. Each parent passes on one of their two species, and they combine in a punnett-square fashion. Occasionally, minor traits may be inherited from the species of a parent that didn't get passed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an Ithrinian gives their species (technically race), they'll usually give the species that they inherited from their father first, followed by the species they inherited from their mother.
